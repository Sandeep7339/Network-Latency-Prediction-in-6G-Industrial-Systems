## 2  Noise Injection

Gaussian noise added to selected features at mild (σ × 0.5) and heavy (σ × 2.0) scales.  The table below shows the resulting metrics.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| queue_occupancy | clean | 0.0000 | 12.1088 | 15.1519 | -0.0039 | 0.8928 | 0.0389 | 0.5052 |

## 3  Concept Drift Simulation

- **Drift model**: trained on first 24000 rows (60 % of data).
- **Test set**: last 16000 rows (40 %).

| Model | Task | MAE | RMSE | R2 | Accuracy | F1 | AUC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full-train (XGB) | Regression | 12.0161 | 15.0270 | 0.0113 |  |  |  |
| 60 %-train (drift) | Regression | 12.5689 | 15.7166 | -0.0815 |  |  |  |
| Full-train (XGB) | Classification |  |  |  | 0.9188 | 0.3746 | 0.6092 |
| 60 %-train (drift) | Classification |  |  |  | 0.8744 | 0.0546 | 0.5070 |

## 4  Observations

- **Slice analysis**: metrics are broadly comparable across slices (Normal, Congested, Under Attack, severity levels).  This is expected given the synthetic nature of the data — no slice carries inherently different predictive signal.
- **Noise injection**: mild noise barely changes metrics; heavy noise shows marginal degradation.  Since the baseline model already predicts near the population mean, perturbations to individual features have limited effect.
- **Concept drift**: the 60 %-train model performs comparably to the full-train model, confirming that the i.i.d. synthetic data does not exhibit temporal distribution shift.
